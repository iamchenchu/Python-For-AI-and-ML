"""
To map the real world scenarios, we started using objects in the code.
this is called object oriented programming.

Initially we used procedural programming : reads and perform the tasks line by line 
later we started using functions : where we used to create a block of codes and used them when ever we required : redundancy will be decreased and reusability will be increased
now we will be creating objects of class : class is kind of a blue print of object, we can create a custemised data type and use them as per our requirement

class : is a blueprint for creating objects
