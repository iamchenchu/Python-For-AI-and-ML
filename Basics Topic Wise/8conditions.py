# we usually use conditions using comparision operators and logical operators

age = 20                                        # in this example we are creating a condition using >,== operators and creating a branching of statements to print
if(age>18):
    print("you can enter the concert")
elif(age==18):
    print("You can come next year")
else:
    print("Kid you are not allowed here")
print("Move on!!")


A = True
B = False
 # now let's see some examples using logical operators 

print(A and B ) # prints False coz in and logic when both sates are true then it will return true  else false
print(A or B ) # return True coz in or operator, if any of the one state is true then it is true
