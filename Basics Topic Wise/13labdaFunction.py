# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression
# lambda arguments : expression

x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c       # here we are trying to print the sum
print(x(5, 6, 2))

mul = lambda a,b,c : a * b * c       #here we are trying to print the multiplication
print(x(2,3,4))
