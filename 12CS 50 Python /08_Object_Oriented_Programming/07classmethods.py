"""Notice how the __init__ method is removed because we donâ€™t need to instantiate a hat anywhere in our code. self, therefore, is no longer 
relevant and is removed. We specify this sort as a @classmethod, replacing self with cls. Finally, notice how Hat is capitalized by 
convention near the end of this code, because this is the name of our class."""
