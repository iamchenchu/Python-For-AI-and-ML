dictionary = {
    "name" : "chenchu",
    "year_of_birth" : 1998,
    "country" : "India",
    "University" : "USD"
}

print(dictionary)  # returns all the elemets in the dictionary
print(dictionary["name"]) # return the names in the dicitionary
print(type(dictionary))  # returns the type as dict class
print(len(dictionary)) #prints the number of pairs in the dictionary

### As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered

### Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
